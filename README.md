It adds immersion and professionalism to your flights, making every takeoff and landing more realistic.  

## Settings
ToLoadHUB provides a customizable configuration through the `toloadhub.ini` file, which is automatically created in the FlyWithLua scripts folder. Below are the available settings:  

### General Settings  
- **Auto Open ToLoad Hub Window**: Automatically opens the ToLoad Hub window upon simulator launch if the aircraft is compatible.  
- **Automatically Initialize Airplane**: Automatically sets the aircraft values to zero on simulator startup.
- **Simulate Fuel**: If enabled, the plugin manages the fuel.
- **When initializing, reset the fuel to an empty tank**: If enabled, fuel is set to zero during the reset phase.
- **Simulate Cargo**: If enabled, cargo loading/unloading is simulated; otherwise, it is loaded instantly.
- **Load cargo with pax boarding**: If selected, cargo loading will start simultaneously with passenger boarding.
Not visibile if Starting with loading cargo is checked.
- **Starting with loading cargo**: When selected, cargo loading will begin, and passengers will require a manual action via a button to start boarding. The button will be visible during the loading process.
- **Use Imperial Units**: Set Imperial units. SimBrief has priority over this value. If SimBrief plan is set to KGS, the units are metric. If SimBrief is set to POUNDS, the units are imperial.
- **Auto Start and Stop JD Ground Hanling**: If JD Ground Handling is installed, you can autostart it.
- **Mute the 'Invalid Airplane' message for ToloadHUB**: Mute the initial message if the airplane ICAO is not compatibile with ToLoadHUB

### SimBrief Settings  
- **Username**: Your SimBrief username.
- **Auto Fetch at Beginning**: Automatically fetches data from SimBrief when the plugin loads.  
- **Randomize Passenger**: Simulates real passenger variations based on SimBrief data. For example, if SimBrief indicates 100 passengers, some may not board, or extra passengers may be simulated.
- **Round up the fuel**: This setting allows you to round up fuel to the nearest 10, 50, or 100. If 'No' is selected, the fuel amount remains unchanged.

- **Loadsheet for chocks on and off**:  Sends a CPDLC message at FL100 with chocks-off and takeoff times, and another after you turn off your beacon and engines, including landing.
